This was a simple project for me to learn JavaScript and better understand CSS. I always wanted to learn a JS framework but I had the idea that I needed to fully understand JavaScript in order to make projects using a framework. And because of that idea I kept procrastinating learning JavaScript, and I didn't want to get stuck in tutorial hell. So, one day I decided to just go with it by choosing a framework that I think looks cool and creating a project that's bare minimum so that I don't overwhelm myself with project ideas that are beyond my knowledge of the language. I stumbled upon three.js and looked at the documentation for it and realized that the syntax was pretty simple. I read the documentation for a while, watched a video on Youtube, and asked ChatGPT on how I could get started. I was able to get the shapes using three.js pretty quickly but struggled a bit on formatting using CSS. I spent a good amount of time just changing CSS properties to get the result that I wanted, and finally decided to treat each shape scene as a box, hence why I used flexbox.

Overall, this was a fun one-day project that I made during the weekend to improve my skills and knowledge.
